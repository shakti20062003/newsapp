## 💡 How It Works

- The app initializes and fetches recent news data from a news API.
- The fetched articles are displayed in a list with titles, snippets, dates, and links.
- Users can search for specific terms (if implemented) and filter results accordingly.
- Clicking an article opens the full content (or external link) for reading.
